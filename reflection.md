#### Week 2

This week, the HTML exercises were mostly straightforward. The trickiest parts were working with tables and forms, as they required more structuring.

For the table, I wasn’t sure how to make the borders look similar to the example, so I ended up checking the example code. As for the forms, I tried to solve them without looking the example. I had some trouble with the "Favorite Character" section. I wasn’t sure how to format it to look like the example, so i ended up using div. I also ran into an issue where I could select multiple characters. It turned out the problem was due to a bad labal.

Overall, these small challenges helped reinforce some of the concepts  learn from the lecture and to experience html for the first time.

#### Week 3

I understand that accessibility is about ensuring that everyone, regardless of their abilities, can use and interact with digital content without issues. In a form, structure plays a crucial role in usability, which is why it's essential to provide clear labels for inputs, use semantic elements like fieldset and legent, and maintain a well-organized layout. Improving accessibility often involves correctly associating labels with their corresponding inputs, fot the navigation and and the compatibility with screen readers for a more inclusive experience.

### CSS

#### Week 5

The CSS lab was quite challenging. The concepts of child selectors, descendant selectors, and attribute selectors are still confusing to grasp, although they're really helpful when applying CSS to different elements in HTML.The positioning exercise was the most difficult and took me more time to figure out. At the beginning, I wasn't sure how to control the different movements until I removed the margins and used positioning properties (top and left set to 0) to properly align the elements.
