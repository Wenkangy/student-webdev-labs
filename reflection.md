#### Week 2

This week, the HTML exercises were mostly straightforward. The trickiest parts were working with tables and forms, as they required more structuring.

For the table, I wasn’t sure how to make the borders look similar to the example, so I ended up checking the example code. As for the forms, I tried to solve them without looking the example. I had some trouble with the "Favorite Character" section. I wasn’t sure how to format it to look like the example, so i ended up using div. I also ran into an issue where I could select multiple characters. It turned out the problem was due to a bad labal.

Overall, these small challenges helped reinforce some of the concepts  learn from the lecture and to experience html for the first time.

#### Week 3

I understand that accessibility is about ensuring that everyone, regardless of their abilities, can use and interact with digital content without issues. In a form, structure plays a crucial role in usability, which is why it's essential to provide clear labels for inputs, use semantic elements like fieldset and legent, and maintain a well-organized layout. Improving accessibility often involves correctly associating labels with their corresponding inputs, fot the navigation and and the compatibility with screen readers for a more inclusive experience.
